## 🟢 Project 1 — Maize Guard
**AI-Powered Crop Quality & Disease Detection System**  

**Category:** Computer Vision · Ethical AI · Agriculture Tech  
**Timeline:** Early Bootcamp Project (Week 2)

### Overview
Maize Guard is an AI-powered computer vision prototype designed to assist farmers, inspectors, and agricultural stakeholders in identifying maize kernel quality and potential crop disease patterns. The project addresses a real-world agricultural challenge in South Africa, where manual inspection is slow, inconsistent, and difficult to scale across large farming operations.

### Problem Statement
Traditional crop inspection relies heavily on human judgment, which introduces inconsistency, fatigue, and bias. In regions where access to expert agricultural inspectors is limited, early-stage crop defects or disease indicators are often missed, leading to reduced yields and financial loss.

### Solution
Maize Guard uses image-based AI classification to analyze maize kernels and categorize them into healthy, broken, or defective classes. The system simulates a real-world AI pipeline from data ingestion to inference and output interpretation, designed to be accessible even to users without advanced technical knowledge.

### Technical Implementation
- Image classification using pre-trained and fine-tuned vision models  
- Dataset creation and labeling for maize kernel conditions  
- Confidence score outputs to support decision-making  
- Structured inference flow: image input → model evaluation → classification result  
- Prototype dashboard concept for scalable deployment  

### Ethical & Social Considerations
- Analysis of bias in region-specific training data  
- POPIA-aligned data handling and image privacy  
- Risks of over-automation in farming decisions  
- Accessibility for rural and low-connectivity environments  
- Environmental considerations of AI model training  

### Visual Assets (Reserved Space)
- Model training screenshots  
- Sample maize kernel images  
- Classification results UI  
- AI workflow diagrams

## 🔵 Project 2 — Creative Writing Content Generator
**Generative AI System for Structured Creative Output**  

**Category:** Generative AI · Prompt Engineering · UX Design  
**Timeline:** Week 3

### Overview
The Creative Writing Content Generator is a generative AI application that demonstrates how structured prompt engineering can enhance creative output rather than replace it. The system helps users generate short stories, poetry, and experimental narratives while retaining human creative control.

### Problem Statement
Many generative writing tools produce outputs that feel generic, unstructured, or overly verbose. Without thoughtful prompt design, creativity often degrades into randomness.

### Solution
This project introduces a modular prompt-engineering system where users define tone, genre, narrative structure, and length. The AI acts as a creative collaborator rather than a replacement for human authorship.

### Technical Implementation
- Prompt templates structured by genre and narrative intent  
- Parameterized controls for tone, length, and style  
- Input validation and output refinement logic  
- Performance considerations such as response time and token efficiency  
- Exportable content formats (text and document-ready output)  

### Engineering Focus
- Prompt abstraction and reuse  
- Human-in-the-loop AI design  
- Controlled creativity through constraints  

### Visual Assets (Reserved Space)
- Generator UI screenshots  
- Prompt template examples  
- Generated content previews  
- Demo video placeholder

## 🟣 Project 3 — AI Resume Builder Studio
**Intelligent Resume Generation & ATS Optimization Platform**  

**Category:** Applied AI · Career Tech · Product Design  
**Timeline:** Week 4

### Overview
The AI Resume Builder Studio is a practical AI-driven platform designed to help users create professional, ATS-optimized resumes tailored to specific job roles. The project focuses on real-world hiring constraints and recruiter screening systems.

### Problem Statement
Many qualified candidates are filtered out by automated Applicant Tracking Systems due to poorly structured resumes, weak keyword alignment, or unclear achievement descriptions.

### Solution
This system guides users through structured resume creation while leveraging AI to generate professional summaries, quantify achievements, and align content with job descriptions.

### Technical Implementation
- AI-generated summaries and bullet points  
- Job description keyword matching  
- ATS-aware formatting logic  
- Multi-template resume system  
- Export functionality (PDF, DOCX, HTML)  

### Design & UX Focus
- Step-by-step resume construction  
- Real-time preview and feedback  
- User data privacy considerations  

### Visual Assets (Reserved Space)
- Resume editor UI  
- Template previews  
- ATS optimization indicators  
- Demo video placeholder

## 🟠 Project 4 — Sentiment-O-Meter
**Real-Time NLP Sentiment Analysis Application**  

**Category:** NLP · Transformers · Model Deployment  
**Timeline:** Week 5

### Overview
Sentiment-O-Meter is a lightweight natural language processing application that classifies text sentiment in real time. The project demonstrates practical deployment of transformer-based models for everyday analytical use cases.

### Problem Statement
Understanding sentiment at scale is critical for feedback analysis, customer engagement, and social monitoring, yet many solutions are either overly complex or inaccessible.

### Solution
A simple, responsive interface that allows users to input text and receive instant sentiment classification along with confidence scores.

### Technical Implementation
- Transformer-based sentiment classification  
- Clean inference pipeline  
- Confidence score interpretation  
- Streamlit-based deployment  
- UI optimized for clarity and speed  

### Engineering Focus
- Model inference efficiency  
- User-friendly ML deployment  
- Interpretable AI outputs  

### Visual Assets (Reserved Space)
- Application UI screenshots  
- Inference workflow diagram  
- Sentiment output examples

## 🔴 Project 5 — Eskom Electricity Demand Forecasting (Capstone)
**National-Scale Time Series Forecasting System**  

**Category:** Data Engineering · Machine Learning · Forecasting  
**Timeline:** Capstone Project

### Overview
This capstone project delivers a full end-to-end machine learning system designed to forecast hourly electricity demand for Eskom using real South African energy consumption data. The system addresses a mission-critical infrastructure challenge with direct economic and societal impact.

### Problem Statement
Accurate electricity demand forecasting is essential for grid stability, cost efficiency, and load-shedding prevention. Traditional forecasting methods struggle to adapt to complex temporal patterns and external variability.

### Solution
A robust forecasting pipeline that transforms raw operational data into actionable demand predictions using advanced machine learning techniques.

### Technical Implementation
